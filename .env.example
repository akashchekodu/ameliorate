# sentry will not process events from localhost without adjusting inbound filter on sentry.io https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/data-management/filtering/ - did this because people sometimes would run Ameliorate and set env to production and start getting a bunch of nonsense errors logged to sentry
# setting `environment` in `instrumentation.ts`'s `Sentry.init` wouldn't work for server setup, but the fallback env variable `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` does.

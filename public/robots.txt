# Following google's parsing syntax https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/robots_txt
# which allows comments with '#' and using '$' to indicate end of a path
# '/about' is disallowed because it seems like that path was originally indexed, and now doesn't exist, so headlesschrome keeps going to it and triggering an error.

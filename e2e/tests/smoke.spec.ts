/**
 * Intended to make sure the app still works, running nightly.
 *
 * This was separated from regression.spec.ts because previously we were using screenshots in the
 * smoke test, but those are sometimes flaky, and that's much more annoying for daily builds than
 * on PRs. So now we just run screenshot tests for PRs, and daily tests can just ensure that app
 * functionality still works, without relying on screenshots.

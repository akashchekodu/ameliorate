/**
 * Intended to capture high-level screenshot tests that should run on each PR.
 *
 * There's a known issue where fonts sometimes render differently (font kerning?), despite us using Docker;
 * but the value of seeing UI diffs to high-use pages (e.g. landing, app) seems worth having some
 * noise on PRs, since that noise can be auto-committed without much issue.
